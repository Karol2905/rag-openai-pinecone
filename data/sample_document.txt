Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced architecture that enhances large language models by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative capabilities.

Traditional large language models generate responses based only on the data they were trained on. This can lead to hallucinations or outdated information.

RAG solves this problem by retrieving relevant documents from an external knowledge base before generating a response. The system first converts documents into vector embeddings and stores them in a vector database.

When a user submits a query, the system converts the query into a vector and searches for the most similar document chunks using cosine similarity. The retrieved context is then provided to the language model to generate a more accurate and grounded answer.

Vector databases such as Pinecone are commonly used in RAG systems because they enable efficient similarity search across large collections of embeddings.

Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. In this project, we use HuggingFace embeddings to generate 384-dimensional vectors.

The overall RAG pipeline consists of the following steps:
1. Document loading
2. Text chunking
3. Embedding generation
4. Vector storage
5. Similarity retrieval
6. Context-aware generation
